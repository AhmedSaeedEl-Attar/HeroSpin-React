## HeroSpin App

#### About Project:

Sometimes, having too many options can be overwhelming. Weâ€™ve all been there. Restaurants with long
menus, a piece of clothing in many different colors, and of course, a quiet evening in front of the TV, not
knowing what to watch. Especially with the last one, sometimes it would be great if someone could
make that call for us. And since most of us, are also playing with our phone, while in front of the TV (if
not also controlling the TV), what could be better than an app, that randomly picks a show for you
